## Pretest

You have provided **`r length(params$dois)`** DOIs.

We first check whether these DOIs *could* have compliant open access metadata.
DOIs that do not meet one or more of following criteria are excluded from the below analysis.

```{r pretest, results = "asis"}
report_metacheckable(params$dois, lang = lang)
```

```{r filter, include = FALSE}
dois <- params$dois[is_metacheckable(params$dois)]
enough <- length(dois) > 1
```

## Test Results

```{r enough, eval = !enough, results = "asis"}
cat("Not enough DOIs remain to run the test.")
```

The following analysis covers only the remaining **`r length(dois)`** DOIs.

```{r import, include = FALSE}
cr <- get_cr_md(dois)
mcres <- cr_compliance_overview(cr)
```


### Overview

The below table summarises the test results.

```{r metrics_overview}
metrics_overview(mcres$cr_overview) %>%
   ind_table_to_gt(.color = "#00A4A7", lang = lang)
```

The table shows absolute counts and relative shares.

Tests include:

- **CC License**: Availability of Creative Commons (CC) licenses
- **Compliant CC**: Availability of compliant Creative Commons (CC) licenses
- **TDM Support**: Support for text and data mining (TDM)
- **Funder info**: Information regarding bodies funding the publication
- **ORCID**: [Open Researcher and Contributor ID](https://orcid.org) for authors
- **Open Abstracts**: [Open Abstracts](https://i4oa.org/) metadata
- **Open Citations**: [Open Citations](https://i4oc.org/)) metadata

Below are the results for each test in greater detail.


### Creative-Commons Licenses

Open content licenses are essential to govern access and re-use to open access journal articles. 

metacheck normalizes Creative Commons licenses and maps them to the different variants in use such as CC BY.
We also check if license statements are compliant.

#### Used CC Licenses

The below table shows the number and percentage by Creative Commons variant. 

```{r cc_metrics}
cc_metrics(mcres$cc_license_check) %>%
  ind_table_to_gt(.color =  "#F3A9BB", lang = lang)
```

Many research funders recommend CC-BY, in particular those supporting the [Plan S Principles](https://www.coalition-s.org/plan_s_principles/). 
`NA` indicates articles where no licence metadata was found. 


#### Compliance of CC Licensing Information

The below table displays the number and percentage of articles with compliant license metadata. 

```{r cc_compliance}
cc_compliance_metrics(mcres$cc_license_check) %>%
  ind_table_to_gt(.color = "#A0A5A9", lang = lang)
```

We consider license metadata as compliant, if and only if:

- the license URL represents a Creative Commons license URL,
- the Creative Commons license refers to the publisher version, the so-called "version-of-record", and
- the Creative Commons license came into effect at the date of publication (exclusion of delayed OA).

We noted that while more and more publishers do provide Creative Commons license metadata through Crossref, some metadata is still incomplete. 
This can negatively affect the discovery and re-use of open access articles. 
**If you observe license metadata issues, we strongly encourage you to contact the publisher**


#### Text and Data Mining (TDM)

The below table summarises which ([MIME
Type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types/Common_types)) file formats are supported for text and data mining (TDM).

```{r tdm_metrics}
tdm_metrics(mcres$tdm) %>%
  ind_table_to_gt(.color =  "#9B0056", lang = lang)
```

Crossref metadata can include more than one format for each DOI.
Therefore, percentages can add to more than 100%. 

We recommend that publishers do not only provide PDF files for TDM purposes, but also XML to promote automated re-use.


### Funding Information

The funding context of research articles becomes more and more important in open access monitoring. 
A growing number of publishers use Crossref to share such information. 

The below table displays the share of DOIs with such funding information, along with the three most frequent funders among the DOIs submitted.
Crossref metadata can include more than one funder for each DOI.

```{r funder_info}
funder_metrics(mcres$funder_info) %>%
  ind_table_to_gt(.color = "#000099", lang = lang)
```

Here again, Crossref metadata can include more than one funder for each DOI, and the percentages can add to more than 100%.

Please note that due to the (still) limited coverage of Crossref, results may not be suitable to comprehensively analyse funding contexts of a publication.


### Attachment

An attached Excel-Spreadsheet allows you to build on our analysis. 

It contains the following sheets with article-level metadata:

- `cr_overview`: Overview  
- `cc_license_check`: License metadata 
- `tdm`: Full-text links for Text and Data Mining (TDM)
- `funder_info`: Funder information
- `pretest`: Pre-test
